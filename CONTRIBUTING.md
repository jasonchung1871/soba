# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This project welcomes improvements, bug fixes, and new features from anyone.

This document outlines expectations for contributors and reviewers so that changes remain understandable, maintainable, and aligned with the project’s direction.

## Before you begin

Please keep the following in mind when contributing:

- Follow the project’s Code of Conduct.
- Discuss significant ideas or architectural changes with the team before starting work.
- Write clear, focused commits using **Conventional Commits** (CI enforces this).
- Add tests or documentation when they meaningfully improve clarity, stability, or future maintenance.
- Keep pull requests small and focused when possible.

## How to contribute

### 1. Fork or branch

You may contribute by:

- creating a branch in this repository, or
- forking the repository and submitting a pull request

Either workflow is acceptable unless the team defines something more specific later.

### 2. Make your changes

When implementing changes:

- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Follow the existing coding style
- Run linting and tests where applicable
- Update documentation when behavior or usage changes

### 3. Commit messages

This project uses **Conventional Commits** because CI and automated releases depend on it.

Examples:

- `feat: add submission filtering`
- `fix: correct null check in auth middleware`
- `chore: update dependencies`

CI will validate commit messages automatically.

### 4. Open a pull request

When opening a PR:

- Provide a short description of _what_ changed and _why_
- Include context that helps reviewers understand the change
- Link related issues or discussions if relevant
- Ensure CI checks pass

Large or complex changes may require discussion or iteration with reviewers.

## Licensing

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the repository.

## Questions or discussions

If you’re unsure about anything—approach, scope, naming, tests, or design—feel free to start a discussion or ask the team before investing significant time.
