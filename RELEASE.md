# Release Process

This project uses automated versioning and changelog generation powered by **semantic‑release**. The goal is to keep development fast and flexible while still producing consistent version numbers and release notes.

## What semantic‑release does

When changes are merged into the repository:

- It analyzes commit messages (using Conventional Commits)
- It determines the next version number
- It updates `CHANGELOG.md`
- It updates the version in `package.json`
- It commits those changes back to the repository

## What semantic‑release does _not_ do

In this project’s configuration:

- It does **not** create Git tags
- It does **not** publish GitHub releases
- It does **not** deploy or publish artifacts

This allows the team to use feature flags, merge work early, and keep development moving without automatically producing public releases.

## Production releases

Production releases are created manually by tagging a commit.  
A typical manual release looks like:

```
git tag v1.4.0
git push origin v1.4.0
```

The version number used for tagging should match the version already generated by semantic‑release in `package.json`.

This approach keeps full control in the hands of DevOps while still benefiting from automated versioning and changelog generation.
